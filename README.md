# Hi there 👋 I'm Fuchang Chen — Rocketing through robotics! 🚀

I'm a systems student at Sun Yat-sen University (School of Systems Science and Engineering) with a playful obsession for turning perception, control, planning, and navigation ideas into autonomous behavior. I build and test systems from simulation to flight — fast, robust, and fun.

## 🧭 How I Work
- I value reproducibility: documented experiments, launch scripts, and clear READMEs.  
- I prefer iterative development: small, testable improvements and frequent validation in sim and flight.  
- I enjoy collaboration — especially on perception/control stacks, path planning, and drone autonomy.
